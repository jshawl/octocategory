* **Test Drive It.** Use TDD as you are developing your app.  At a minimum, all of your models and their relationships should have tests.
* **Models.** Your app should have at least 3 models. Make sure they are associated correctly!
* **Views.** Use partials to DRY (Donâ€™t Repeat Yourself) up your views.
* **Handles invalid data.** Forms in your application should validate data (on the **BACKEND** in models and controllers) and handle incorrect inputs. Validate sign up information, verify necessary model fields are populated (not blank) for required fields, valid email addresses, etc.
* **Use an API** APIs add data and functionality to your app (some have gems!)
* **User Login.** Make sure you have a user model with basic authentication and authorization set up.
* **Heroku.** Deploy your code to Heroku with a PostgreSQL database.

## CHALLENGE ADD-ONS
We may cover some of these during the week, and we encourage you to incorporate them into your app, optionally consider doing some of the following with your app.

* **Front-end Framework.** Use either Twitter Bootstrap or Foundation to kick start your front-end.
* **Web Scraping.** Check out Nokogiri.
